# DES Encryption and Decryption Algorithm

This is an implementation of the DES algorithm for the CSE825 Computer and Network Security
graduate-level class at Michigan State University.

A good outline of the algorithm can be found here:

As part of the assignment, we had to write our own implementation of the DES encryption algorithm,
encrypt a secret message, and trade with another group to decrypt theirs as they decrypt ours.

There is as such code for both encryption and brute force decryption (albiet on a smaller search
space than the full bitstring).

This was a partnered project with Darius Nafar, a PhD candidate at MSU. The code quality is a bit
haphazard on account of it being a group endeavor originally on a google collab ipynb.

Enjoy :)
